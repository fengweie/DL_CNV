# A Pytorch Implementation of BAPA-Net: Boundary Adaptation and Prototype Alignment for Cross-domain Semantic Segmentation (ICCV 2021 oral)

## Requirements
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

- Download datasets

- Example of testing a model with domain adaptation with CityScapes as target domain(***class_num=16***)
    `python3 evaluateUDA.py --model-path *checkpoint.pth* --class-num 16`
